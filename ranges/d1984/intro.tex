\rSec0[motivation]{Changing the return types for ranges algorithms with alias return types}

This proposal resolves GB316 and GBxxx

Each algorithm should have its own result type (that might be derived from some common
exposition-only type). It will be probably be confusing for a diagnostic to report
\tcode{copy_result} as the return type when a user is using \tcode{move_backward}, or for
\tcode{mismatch_result} to appear when a user is using \tcode{swap_ranges}!

LEWG approved to move this to LWG in Belfast.
