# Target-audience tables

## Abstract

Section 4.4 of P1362 uses a form of table that identifies who the target audiences are for certain
parts of coroutine usage. The authors believe that other proposals could drastically benefit from
such tables to help communicate the teachability of proposals and what they believe
beginners-through-experts should be using.

## Motivation

P1362 ยง4.4 discussses whether or not coroutines are an expert-only feature. It communicates this --
in part -- by using a table that splits programmers into four categories, as shown in Table 1.

<table>
   <tr>
      <th>Who</th>
      <th>What</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Everybody (millions)</td>
      <td>
         Uses coroutines via high level syntax powered by coroutine types and awaitables defined by
         the standard library, boost and other high-quality libraries.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Power user (10,000)</td>
      <td>
         Aware of <i>Awaitable</i> concept.<br />
         <br />
         Defines new awaitables to customize await for their environment using existing coroutine
         types.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Expert (1,000)</td>
      <td>
         Aware of <i>Awaitable</i> and <i>Coroutine Promise</i> concepts.<br />
         <br />
         Defines new coroutine types.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Cream of the crop (200)</td>
      <td>
         Defines metafuncitons, utilities and adapters that can help to compose awaitables, write
         utility coroutine adapters, etc.
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>
